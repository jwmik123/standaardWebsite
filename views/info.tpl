Maroon 5’s releases have also gone gold and platinum in over 35 countries.</p>
     <p>Maroon 5 won over fans and critics alike with the hybrid rock/R&B sound they introduced on their debut album, Songs About Jane and their double platinum album, It Won't be Soon Before Long, which included hits like "Makes Me Wonder" and "If I Never See your Face Again." In 2010, the band released their third studio album, Hands All Over, which featured the hit singles “Misery” and the anthemic “Moves Like Jagger,” which climbed to the #1 spot on the Top 40 and Hot AC charts, as well as claiming the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100.
     Both singles received GRAMMY Award nominations in the category of "Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals.”

With the success of the track on the Hot 100 chart, Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine also notably became the first artist in the chart's 53-year history to reach #1 as part of a group, while entering the Top 10 at the same time as a soloist, as he was featured on and co-wrote Gym Class Heroes’ top single, “Stereo Hearts."</p>
